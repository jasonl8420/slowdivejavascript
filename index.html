                <p><u>Slowdive JavaScript</u></P>
                <p>JavaScript, the web's programming language is not only difficult to learn, but it is also
                    somewhat
                    overwhelming with how many layers there are to understand: how programming works, what the
                    terms
                    mean,
                    how to write in the language, and how to apply this knowledge towards practical use. This
                    information can become dense, further complicated by fine-detailed specifications for
                    software
                    engineers.</p>
                <p>For this reason, the subject as whole is daunting to beginners. A high
                    level
                    of detail, while essential for specialists, is a huge obstacle to the less experienced.
                    Consequently, the less-experienced like myself are tempted to adoopt haphzard programming
                    methods,
                    like copying and
                    pasting code. While getting something to work is important, I have also realized how you get
                    there
                    is
                    also just as important.</p>

                <p>Slowdive JavaScript is a not a guide persay, but rather a personal space for
                    me to reorganize the information and content I've gathered about JavaScript throughout my on
                    going journey in learning the language: it allows me to reiterate and reinforce my learning in
                    foundations of JavaScript thus far. That is not to say Slowdive JavaScript is not a guide
                    either, as simplified as the content is for my own understanding,
                    I would hope people leave the page feeling less intmidiated and more intrigued about
                    learning
                    JavaScript.+_!+= </p>

            <!-- Getting started with javascript -->
            <div class="page-content" id="item2-content">
                <p><u>Getting Started</u></p>
                <p>To get started with JavaScript, you'll need a code editor and a web browser. You can write JavaScript
                    code in any plain text editor, but code editors like Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, or Atom offer
                    features that make coding easier.
                    In addition to a code editor, you'll need a web browser to run and test your JavaScript code.
                    Browsers like Chrome and Mozilla FireFox have built-in developer tools that allow you to inspect and
                    debug your code. </p>

                <p>Now that you have a background understanding of JavaScript, it's time to dive in and learn more
                    about the
                    foundation of the programming language. In the following sections of this website, we'll explore
                    JavaScript step by step, covering fundamental concepts and practical examples.!+_@=

            <!-- Brief history about javascript -->
            <div class="page-content" id="item3-content">
                <p><u>JavaScript</u></p>
                <p>Historically, JavaScript was first known as LiveScript, making its appearance in 1995, but Netscape
                    changed its name to JavaScript, possibly because of the excitement being generated by Java. Keep in
                    mind that JavaScript and Java are two completely different languages both in concept and design:
                    Java (developed by Sun Microsystems) is a powerful and much more complex programming language.</p>
                <div class="container">
                    <p> Javascript is a dynamic computer programming language. JavaScript is most commonly used as a
                        part of web
                        pages, whose implementations allow <span class="moreDetail">client-side scripts</span> to
                        interact with the user and create dynamic
                        pages. In addition, Javascript is also:

                        Client-side scripts refer to scripts that run on the client's (user's) web browser rather than
                        on the web server.

                        <li>The de-facto language of digital experience </li>
                        <li> Commonly used in conjunction with HTML/CSS to add interactivity </li>
                        <li> A lightweight programming language </li>
                        <li> An interpreted language (means that scripts execute without preliminary compilation) </li>

                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>Now let's take a look at some advantages and disadvantages of JavaScript.</p>

                <p><u>Advantages of JavaScript</u>
                <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
                    <li>Less server interaction: You can validate user input before sending the
                        page off to the server. This saves server traffic, which means less load on
                        your server.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Immediate feedback to the visitors: They don't have to wait for a
                        page reload to see if they have forgotten to enter something.

                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        Increased interactivity: You can create interfaces that react when the
                        user hovers over them with a mouse or activates them via the keyboard.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        Richer interfaces: You can use JavaScript to include such items as drag-and-drop components and
                        sliders to give a rich Interface to your site
                        visitors.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p><u>Limitations of JavaScript</u></p>
                <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
                    <li>Client-side JavaScript does not allow the reading or writing of files. This
                        has been kept for security reason.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        JavaScript cannot be used for networking applications because there is no
                        such support available.
                    </li>
                    <br>

                    <li>
                        JavaScript doesn't have any multithreading or multiprocessor capabilities.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>Keep in mind, JavaScript is a lightweight, interpreted programming language that
                    allows you to build interactivity into otherwise static HTML pages.</p>

            </div>


            <!-- How to link javascript  -->
            <div class="page-content" id="item4-content">
                <p><u>Environment</u></p>
                <p>We now need a working environment to run our JavaScript codes. While there exists two different
                    working environments, client-side and server-side, this guide will
                    only focus on server-side working environment.</p>

                <p><u>The "Script" Tag</u></p>
                <p>In order for the JavaScript code to be actually executed via the browser, the <span
                        class='variableText'>script</span> tag is used to
                    embed/reference the JavaScript code within an HTML document. </p>

                <p><u>External Scripts</u></p>
                <p>If there is a lot of JavaScript that is being used, rather than utilizing the scripts tag in HTML, a
                    separate file dedicated solely for JavaScript is more convenient. To do so, you can still utilize
                    the scripts tag in addition to the <span class='variableText'>src</span> attribute:</p>
                <pre class="codes"><code class="javascript">  &#60;script src= "/path/to/script.js"&#62;</pre></code>
                <p>Here, <span class='variableText'>/path/to/script.js</span> is an absolute path to the script from the
                    site root. One can also
                    provide a relative path from the current page. For instance, <span
                        class='variableText'>src="script.js"</span>, just like
                    <span class='variableText'>src="./script.js"</span>, would mean a file <span
                        class='variableText'>script.js</span> in the current folder. More detail regarding
                    absolute and relative path will be provided below.
                </p>

                <p>Not only can we also gie a full URL, but attach several scripts as well: </p>

                <pre
                    class="codes"><code class="javascript">  &#60;script src= "/js/script1.js"&#62;&#60;/script&#62; </pre>
                </code>
                <pre
                    class="codes"><code class="javascript">  &#60;script src= "/js/script2.js"&#62;&#60;/script&#62; </pre>
                </code>
                <pre class="codes"><code class="javascript">  ... </pre></code>

                <p><u>Choosing Between Relative and Absolute Paths</u></p>
                <p>The choice between relative and absolute paths depends on your specific use case. The
                    primary purpose of relative paths is to specify the location of a file or resource relative to the
                    current working directory. For this reason, relative paths are commonly used when referencing
                    resources within the same project or subdirectories of the
                    current working directory.
                </p>
                <p>On the other hand, absolute paths provide the full and unambigious
                    location of a file or resource from th root directory
                    of the file system or web server. Absolute paths are commonly used for
                    external resource referencing as well as fixed URLs.
                </p>

                <p>The general rule of thumb for choosing between relative and absolute path is as follows:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Use
                        relative pathfor resources that are part of your project and stored locally (e.g., images,
                        stylesheets, scripts) within your project's directory structure.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        Use absolute paths for external resources outside of your project's directory structure like
                        third-party libraries or fixed URLs to
                        ensure reliable access and potentially benefit from content distribution networks for faster
                        loading times.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        Use both approaches in cases where your project incorporates both internal and
                        external
                        resources.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                </p>

                <p>Numbers are used to represent both whole numbers (integers) and numbers with decimal points
                    (floating-point numbers aka float). You can use numbers for calculations and storing quantities.
                </p>
                <p class="codeDescription">// An integer </p>
                <pre class="codes"><code class="language-javascript">  let age = 25; </pre></code>
                <p class="codeDescription">// A floating-point number, also known as a float</p>
                <pre class="codes"><code class="language-javascript">  let price = 19.99;</code></pre>
                <p><u>Strings</u></p>
                <p>String is a data type that represents a sequence of characters, such as letters, numbers, symbols,
                    and spaces. Strings are used to store and manipulate textual data. They are enclosed in either
                    single quotes (') or double quotes
                    ("), and JavaScript treats them interchangeably. You can
                    manipulate strings by combining them (concatenation), extracting parts of them (substring), and
                    performing various string-related operations.
                </p>

                <div class="codeBox">

                    </code>
                    <pre
                        class="codes"><code class="language-javascript">  let doubleQuotesString = "This is a string using double quotes.";</pre>
                    </code>
                    <pre
                        class="codes"><code class="language-javascript">  let mixedQuotesString = 'You can also use "mixed" quotes in JavaScript.'; </pre>
                    </code>
                    <pre class="codes"><code class="language-javascript">  let emptyString = ''; </pre></code>
                    <pre class="codes"><code class="language-javascript">  let alphanumericString = '12345@#$%^';</pre>
                    </code>

                        <p>Here, textual data has been stored into two differnt variables in the form of
                            strings.Utilizing concatenation and arithmetic operation, which will be discussed
                            later, allows the two
                            variables of strings to be coupled.</p>

                <p><u>Boolean</u></p>
                <p>A boolean is a data type that represents one of two values: <span class='textEmphasis'>true</span> or
                    <span class='textEmphasis'>false</span>. Booleans are used for
                    logical operations, comparisons, and making decisions in your code. They are fundamental to control
                    the flow of your program and implement conditional logic with conditional statements like if, else,
                    and while, which will also be discussed later.
                </p>
                <pre class="codes"><code class="language-javascript">  let x = 5;</pre></code>
                <pre class="codes"><code class="language-javascript">  let y = 10;</pre></code>
                <pre class="codes"><code class="language-javascript">  let isGreaterThan = x > y;</code></pre>
                <p class="codeDescription">// false</p>

                <p class="codeDescription">// false</p>

                <p><u>Null</u></p>
                <p>In JavaScript, null is a special value that represents the intentional absence of any object or
                    value. It is often used to indicate that a variable, property, or value should be empty or have no
                    value. </p>
                <pre class="codes"><code class="language-javascript">  function doNothing() { <br>
    }</pre></code>
                <p class="codeDescription">// The function above does nothing</p>
                <p>code that doesn't execute any meaningful logic or doesn't have any practical purpose.</p>

                <pre class="codes"><code class="language-javascript">  let myVariable = null; </pre></code>
                <pre class="codes"><code class="language-javascript">  console.log(myVariable); </pre></code>
                <p class="codeDescription">// Outputs: null</p>

                <p>However, like other programming languages, null code in JavaScript is generally not desired in
                    real-world applications, as it doesn't contribute to the functionality of the program. It may be
                    used temporarily during development or as a placeholder for future code.</p>

                <p><u>Null vs. Undefined</u></p>
                <p>Given the fact that both null and undefined represent the absence of a value, it is
                    difficult to grasp the difference between the two data types. Here is an analogy that has helped me
                    better understand the distinct difference between null and undefined.</p>

                <p>Undefined:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Think of it as an <span class='textEmphasis'>unknown</span> or <span class='textEmphasis'>not
                            set</span> value
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        It's what you get when you ask for the value of something that hasn't been given any value yet
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li> Ex: Imagine you have a blank sheet of paper; it's like asking, <span
                            class='textEmphasis'>What's written on it?</span>The
                        answer would be <span class='textEmphasis'>undefined</span>because there's nothing on it</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Null:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Think of it as a <span class='textEmphasis'>deliberate emptiness</span> or <span
                            class='textEmphasis'>clearing</span> value
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        It's used when you want to say, <span class='textEmphasis'>I know this thing exists, but right
                            now, it should be empty.</span>
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        Ex: Imagine you have an empty box, and you put a label inside it that says<span
                            class='textVariable'> null.</span> You're
                        saying, <span class='textEmphasis'>This box is meant to be empty on purpose.</span>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <p>Here, various value types, such as numbers, strings, boolean, null, and undefined have been explored.
                    While the importance of remembering the nitty gritty details of different value types might often be
                    overlooked especially by those in hurry to dig into more advanced concepts, values should not be
                    left with such hurry. To properly digest the concepts that will add on later like operators and many
                    more, taking the time with values can be helpful in doing so.

            <div class="page-content" id="item6-content">
                <p><u>Variables</u></p>
                <p>In programming, a variable is like a container or a named storage location that you can use to hold
                    and manipulate data. Think of it as a labeled box where you can store different types of
                    information, such as numbers, text, or even more complex structures like lists of items.</p>

                <p><u>Uses of Variables</u></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Data Storage: Variables serve as data storage units where you can hold and retain information.
                        When you collect data from a user, such as their name or age, you store it in variables so that
                        you can refer to and use that data throughout your program's execution.
                        Without variables, you'd have no way to keep track
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        Data Manipulation: Variables are not just placeholders for data; they enable you to perform
                        operations and transformations on that data.
                        Variables are crucial for data processing, enabling you to manipulate information to produce
                        desired outcomes.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        Readability: One of the fundamental principles of writing clean and maintainable code is
                        readability.
                        Variables enhance the readability of your code by providing meaningful and descriptive names for
                        data. Instead of working with raw values or data scattered throughout your code, you can use
                        variable names that convey the purpose or significance of the data.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        Reusability: You can reuse the same variable to work with different values, making your code
                        more
                        efficient and concise. This also helps to avoid redundancy and reduces the chances of errors.

                <p><u>Declaring A Variable</u></p>
                <p>In the following line of code, we will declare a variable and assign it the value of <span
                        class='textVariable'>56</span>. The first
                    time you declare a variable is known as a variable declaration. </p>
                <pre class="codes"><code class="language-javascript">  var my_variable = 56;</pre></code>

                    <p><span class='variableDetails'>Var</span> is a <span class='moreDetail'>variable statement</span>.
                        It tells the program to begin
                        declaring
                        a variable and that the
                        following word will be the name of that variable.</p>
                    <p><span class='blackCode'>my_variable</span> is an arbitrary name for the
                        variable, decided by the author of the program. You can name a variable anything you want, so
                        long
                        as it is not a <span class="moreDetail">reservered word</span>. This cannot contain spaces
                        either. If you want more than one
                        word
                        for the variable name, use undersecores in between each word. See more about these small details
                        in

                        the same
                        meaning as in mathematics. Here, the sign means "place the value to th right of the sign insdie
                        the
                        variable named on the left." A more accurate sign would have been a left facing arrow:</p>

                <p><u>Different Variable Types</u></p>
                <p> There exist a total of three different variable types: <span class='variableText'>var</span>, <span
                        class='variableText'>let</span>, and <span class='variableText'>const</span>. Variables declared
                    with <span class='variableText'>var</span> have function-level scope, while those declared
                    with <span class='variableText'>let</span> and <span class='variableText'>const</span> have
                    block-level scope. <br><br>Block-level scope means that variables are limited to the
                    block (i.e., within curly braces {}) in which they are defined, such as in loops or conditional
                    statements. In other words, variables set within block-level scope can't be used outside of that
                    particular block in which the variable(s) were declared. Due to this reason, <span
                        class='variableText'>let</span> and <span class='variableText'>const</span> are generally the
                    preferred varialbe types over
                    <span class='variableText'>var</span>: they provide more predictable and safer scoping for your
                    variables,
                    making your code easier to understand and maintain.
                </p>
                <p>In programming, scoping refers to the set of rules that determine where in your code a particular
                    variable or identifier can be accessed or referenced. It defines the visibility and lifetime of
                    variables and other identifiers within your program. Scoping rules help prevent naming conflicts,
                    manage variable lifetimes, and ensure that your code behaves as expected.
                </p>
                <p><u>Best Practices</u></p>
                <p>Here are some seemingly tedious yet important notes to remember about variables:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Use <span class='variableText'>let</span>for most variables, and <span
                            class='variableText'>const</span> for values that should not change.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Name variables with clarity and consistency.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Use camelCase for variable names (e.g, slowDive).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Avoid using reserved words or keywords as variable names.

                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>On to the next.</p>

            <div class="page-content" id="item7-content">
                <p><u>Objects</u></p>
                <p>An object is a fundamental data type used to represent and store collections of related data and
                    functionality. You can think of an object as a container that holds various pieces of information
                    and methods (functions) that operate on that information. Objects are a central concept in
                    JavaScript, and they play a crucial role in structuring and organizing your code.</p>

                <p><u>Object Properties</u></p>
                <p>An object consists of properties, which are essentially key-value pairs. The key is a string (also
                    known as a property name), and the value can be of any data type (e.g., numbers, strings, other
                    objects, functions, etc.).</p>

                <p class="codeDescription">// In this example, name, age, and isStudent are properties (keys) of the

                <p><u>Accessing An Object's Values</u></p>
                <p>To retrieve information from an object, you can ask for the particular value you are looking for
                    through <span class='textEmphasis'>dot.notation</span> or through <span
                        class='textEmphasis'>[bracket] notation</span>. There are subtle differences between each type,
                    but this guide will use dot notation.</p>

                <p><u>Square brackets </u></p>
                <p>
                    For multiword properties, the dot access doesn’t work:

                <pre class="codes"><code class="language-javascript">  user.likes birds = true</pre></code>
                <p class="codeDescription">// this would give a syntax error </p>
                <br>

                JavaScript doesn’t understand that. It thinks that we address <span
                    class='textEmphasis'>user.likes</span>, and then gives a
                syntax error when comes across unexpected birds. <br><br>

                The <span class='textEmphasis'>dot</span> requires the key to be a valid variable identifier. That
                implies: contains no spaces,
                doesn’t start with a digit and doesn’t include special characters ($ and _ are allowed). <br><br>

                There’s an alternative “square bracket notation” that works with any string:

                <pre class="codes"><code class="language-javascript">  let user = {};
                    </pre></code>

                // set
                user["likes birds"] = true;

                // get
                alert(user["likes birds"]); // true

                // delete
                delete user["likes birds"];
                Now everything is fine. Please note that the string inside the brackets is properly quoted (any
                type of quotes will do).

                Square brackets also provide a way to obtain the property name as the result of any expression –
                as opposed to a literal string – like from a variable as follows:

                let key = "likes birds";

                // same as user["likes birds"] = true;
                user[key] = true;
                Here, the variable key may be calculated at run-time or depend on the user input. And then we
                use it to access the property. That gives us a great deal of flexibility.

                For instance:

                let user = {
                name: "John",
                age: 30
                };

                let key = prompt("What do you want to know about the user?", "name");

                // access by variable
                alert( user[key] ); // John (if enter "name")
                The dot notation cannot be used in a similar way:

                let user = {
                name: "John",
                age: 30
                };

                let key = "name";
                alert( user.key ) // undefined
                </p>

                <p><u>Methods</u></p>
                <p>An object can also contain methods, which are functions defined as properties of the object. These
                    methods can perform actions or computations related to the object's data. </p>

                <pre class="codes"><code class="language-javascript">  let car = {

                <p><u>Object as a Container</u></p>
                <p>To simplify your understanding, think of an object as a container that helps you organize related
                    data and functions. For instance,
                    you can use an object to represent a person's information, a car's details, a product's attributes,
                    and so on.</p>

                <p><u>Arrays</u></p>
                <p>An array is an ordered, list-like data structure. In JavaScript particularly, arrays are a
                    specific
                    kind of object that get special treatment. Arrays look different from objects, but operate the
                    same
                    way behind-the-scenes.</p>

                        It tells the program to begin
                        declaring
                        a variable and that thei
                        following word will be the name of that variable.</p>
                    <p><span class='blackCode'>my_variable</span> is an arbitrary name for the
                        variable, decided by the author of the program. You can name a variable anything you want, so
                        long

                </div>

                <p>Array lacks the specificity of objects; each item/element in an array is ordered according to its
                    position in
                    the array with no other unique information that can be assigned. On the other hand, objects
                    allow
                    you to associate named
                    properties (keys) with their corresponding values. This association provides a way to structure
                    and
                    organize data
                    in a more detailed and specific manner compared to arrays. Thus, arrays are typically used for
                    storing
                    ordered collections of values of the same data type. Meaning, unless you need to represent data
                    with
                    specific attributes, relationships, and names for each value, array is the preferred data
                    structure
                    in the case of homogenous set of values where the arrangement of elements holds significance.
                </p>

                <p><u>Declaring and Initializing Arrays</u></p>
                <p>To declare and initialize arrays, there are several ways to go about it: array literal syntax
                    [brackets], Array() constructor, Array.of(), and more. There are subtle differences among them,
                    however, array literal syntax is the most common and straighforward way to declare and intialize
                    arrays. </p>
                <pre class="codes"><code class="language-javascript">  let myArray = []; </pre></code>
                <pre
                    class="codes"><code class="language-javascript">  let fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"];  </pre>
                </code>

                <p><u>Accessing Elements</u></p>
                <pre class="codes"><code class="language-javascript">  let firstFruit = fruits[0]; // "apple"</pre>
                </code>
                <pre class="codes"><code class="language-javascript">  let secondFruit = fruits[1]; // "banana"</pre>
                </code>
                <p>Array elements are accessed using square bracket notation and the element's index. While there
                    must
                    be additional reasons as
                    to
                    why arrays are indexed primarily using sqaure bracket, keep in mind that arrays are typically
                    used
                    to store a
                    numerically-ordered collection of elements hence why the elements are zero-indexed using their
                    relative
                    position in the array. </p>
                <p><u>Nested Arrays</u></p>
                <p>Nested arrays are arrays that contain other arrays as their elements. This allows you to create
                    multi-dimensional data structures, such as matrices or arrays of arrays, to represent more
                    complex
                    data.</p>
                <p>You can nest arrays to any depth you need, creating multi-dimensional arrays. For instance,
                    here's a
                    3D array:</p>
                <pre class="codes"><code class="language-javascript">  let matrix =  [ 
        [
          [1, 2],
          [3, 4]
        ],
        [
          [5, 6],
          [7, 8]
        ]
      ];</pre>
                </code>
                <pre class="codes"><code class="language-javascript">  let element = matrix[1][0[[1]; // 6 
                </pre></code>
                <pre class="codes"><code class="language-javascript">  let element2 = matrix[0][1[[1]; // 4   
                </pre></code>
                <p class="codeDescription">// Despite it being a multi-dimensional array, accessing an element works
                    exactly the same way. Instead, think of it as accessing an element within another element.
                </p>
                <p>Nested arrays are useful when you need to represent structured data or grids of values, like
                    matrices, game boards, or tabular data. They allow you to organize data in a way that mirrors
                    its
                    inherent structure.
                </p>

                <p><u>Adding and Removing Elements</u></p>
                <p>Adding and Removing Elements:
                    JavaScript provides several methods to add and remove elements from an array. For example:

                    push(): Adds an element to the end of the array.
                    pop(): Removes and returns the last element of the array.
                    unshift(): Adds an element to the beginning of the array.
                    shift(): Removes and returns the first element of the array.
                    splice(): Allows you to add, remove, or replace elements at specific positions in the array.</p>

                <pre class="codes"><code class="language-javascript">  fruits.push("orange"); // Adds "orange" to the end of the array
                    let removedFruit = fruits.pop(); // Removes and returns "orange"
                    
                    fruits.unshift("grape"); // Adds "grape" to the beginning of the array
                    let removedFirstFruit = fruits.shift(); // Removes and returns "grape"
                    
                    fruits.splice(1, 1, "kiwi"); // Replaces the second element with "kiwi"</pre>
                </code>

                <p>As a recap, here are a few key characteristics of array to keep in mind before moving forward: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>JavaScript arrays are resizable and can contain a mix of different data types. </li>
                    <br>
                    <li> JavaScript arrays are not associative arrays and so, array elements cannot be accessed
                        using
                        arbitrary strings as indexes, but must be accessed using nonnegative integers as indexes.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>JavaScript arrays are zero-indexed: the first element of an array is at index 0, the second
                        is
                        at index 1, and so on — and the last element is at the value of the array's length property
                        minus 1.</li>

                <p><u>Conditionals</u></p>
                <p>In everyday life, we make decisions based on certain conditions. For example, you might decide to
                    carry an umbrella if the weather forecast predicts rain. Similarly in programming, conditionals
                    are
                    statements
                    that can control whether or not specific code runs. They are called such
                    because they test whether or not a condition is met before deciding to proceed running your
                    program.
                    If
                    the test is evaluated to be true, the code will run; if false it will not and/or may jump to
                    another
                    test.
                </p>
                <p><u>Basic Components</u></p>
                <p>Coniditionals consist of three main parts:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Condition: This is a question or a test that we ask the computer. For example, "Is it
                        raining?"
                        The condition is a Boolean expression, which means it evaluates to either true or false.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        Code to Execute If True: If the condition is true, we specify a block of code that should
                        run.
                        For example, if it's raining, we might want to carry an umbrella.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        Code to Execute If False (Optional): Sometimes, we also specify what should happen if the
                        condition is false. For instance, if it's not raining, we might decide not to carry an
                        umbrella.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p><u>Syntax</u></p>
                <p>There are three types of conditional statements. <span class="variableText">if</span>, <span
                        class="variableText">else</span>, and <span class="variableText">else if</span>. These three get
                    combined in conditional blocks in different ways.
                </p>
                <p>The <span class="variableText">if</span> statement simply tests whether or not one condition is true.
                    If the condition is met, the code inside the braces will run.
                </p>
                <p>An <span class="variableText">else</span> statement comes after an <span
                        class="variableText">if</span> statement and provides an alternative block of code to execute if
                    the <span class="variableText">if</span> condition is false. <br> If the initial condition is true,
                    the code in the first block that comes before the <span class="variableText">else</span> conditional
                    will execute,
                    and the code in the block following that conditional will be skipped.
                </p>
                <p>If the <span class="variableText">if</span> condition is false, the code will be skipped, and the
                    code
                    block that follows the <span class="variableText">if</span> conditin will execute.
                </p>
                <p>An <span class="variableText">else if</span> statement allows you to check multiple conditions in
                    sequence. It comes after an <span class="variableText">if</span>
                    statement or another <span class="variableText">else if</span> statement.
                </p>
                <p>JavaScript checks each condition in order. If <span class="textEmphasis">condition1</span> is true,
                    it executes the code in the first block and skips the rest.
                </p>
                <p>If <span class="textEmphasis">condition1</span> is false, it checks <span
                        class="textEmphasis">condition2</span>: if that particular condition is true, it executes the
                    code in the second block and so on.
                </p>
                <p>If none of the conditions are true, it executes the code in the <span
                        class="variableText">else</span> block (if present).
                </p>

                <p><u>Difference between else-if and multiple if statements</u></p>
                <p>At this point, using <span class="variableText">else if</span> statements seems totally
                    interchangeable with just using multiple
                    <span class="variableText">if</span>
                    statements. While they might seem to work the same way, there is a distinct difference between
                    the two.
                </p>
                <p>When you use multiple <span class="variableText">if</span> statements without <span
                        class="variableText">else if</span>, each <span class="variableText">if</span> condition is
                    evaluated independently.
                    This means that if one <span class="variableText">if</span> condition is true, its corresponding
                    block of code will execute, and then
                    the program will continue to evaluate subsequent <span class="variableText">if</span> conditions
                    regardless of their truth value.
                </p>

                <p>On the other hand, when you use <span class="variableText">else if</span> statements, the conditions
                    are evaluated sequentially. Once a
                    condition is <span class="textEmphasis">true</span>, its corresponding block of code is executed,
                    and the program exits the conditional block. This prevents unnecessary evaluations of subsequent
                    conditions.
                </p>

                <p><u>Which Should You Use?</u></p>
                <p>The choice between using multiple <span class="variableText">if</span> statements or <span
                        class="variableText">else if</span> statements depends on your desired
                    behavior. If you want to independently evaluate and execute multiple conditions, you can use
                    multiple <span class="variableText">if</span> statements. If you want to perform exclusive checks
                    and execute the first <span class="textEmphasis">true</span>
                    condition
                    while ignoring the rest, <span class="variableText">else if</span> statements are generally more
                    suitable for that purpose.

                    In most cases where you have mutually exclusive conditions (e.g., determining a letter grade
                    based
                    on a range), <span class="variableText">else if</span> statements provide a cleaner and more
                    efficient way to structure your code.

            <!-- Loops including for and while loops -->
            <div class="page-content" id="item11-content">
                <p><u>Loops</u></p>
                <p> Loops in JavaScript are like a command to the program: "Do something repeatedly as long as a certain
                    condition holds true." Loops are essential for automating repetitive tasks and processing data
                    efficiently. There are two
                    primary types of loops in JavaScript: the for loop and the while loop.
                </p>

                <p><u>The For Loop</u></p>
                <p>The <span class="variableText">for</span> loop is a structured way to tell the program how many times
                    you want to repeat a particular
                    task.
                </p>
                <p>Initialization: You start by declaring a variable. This variable is like a counter, and you can give
                    it any name you like, except for reserved words. No spaces are allowed; if you want a multi-word
                    variable, use underscores.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Condition: You set a condition that must be true for the loop to keep running. If this condition
                    becomes false, the loop stops.
                </p>

                <p> Iteration: After each cycle of the loop, you update the variable. This usually means increasing or
                    decreasing it by a certain amount.
                </p>

                <p>Here's an example that uses a for loop to count from 1 to 5 and print the numbers: </p>
                <pre class="codes"><code class="language-javascript">
                for (let i = 1; i = 5; i++) { console.log(i); } In this example, let i=1 initializes the counter
                    variable i to 1. i =5 checks if i is less than or equal to 5. If true, the loop continues, and i++
                    increments i by 1 after each iteration. </pre></code>

                <p><u>The While Loop</u></i></p>
                <p>The <span class="variableText">while</span> loop is like saying, "Keep doing something as long as a
                    specific condition remains
                    true." It's used when you don't know in advance how many times you need to repeat a task.
                </p>

                <p>Here's an example that uses a while loop to count from 1 to 10: </p>

                <pre class="codes"><code class="language-javascript">  let loop_count = 0;
                        
  while (loop_count &lt; 10) {
    console.log(loop_count);
    loop_count += 1; 
  }</pre></code>

                <button type="button" class="collapsible">&nbsp; Details</button>
                <div class="content">
                    <p>We first initialize a variable named <span class='blackCode'>loop_count</span> with an initial
                        value of <span class='blackCode'>0</span>. This variable is used
                        to keep track of the current count in the loop.</p>
                    <p>The condition here is the variable <span class='blackCode'>loop_count</span> being less than 10.
                        As long as loop_count is less
                        than 10, the code inside the loop will continue to execute. with <span
                            class='blackCode'>loop_count += 1</span>, the
                        initialized variable is also incremented by one in each iteration. This line not only makes sure
                        the value of the varaible is updated, but also ensures that the loop eventually exits. </p>
                    <p>Once the variable becomes 10 or greater, the condition is no longer true: the loop exits.</p>
                </div>
                <p><u>Understanding the Difference: 'for' vs. 'while'</u></p>
                <p>The <span class='variableText'>while</span> Loop
                    Structure:
                    The while loop offers a simpler structure, focusing solely on the loop's condition.
                    It's your choice when you want to execute a block of code repeatedly as long as a
                    specific condition remains true.
                </p>
                <p>Use Cases:
                    Use the while loop when you don't know in advance how many iterations are required.
                    It's ideal for situations where the loop's termination depends on dynamic
                    conditions, such as user input validation or processing data until a certain state
                    is reached.
                </p>
                <p>The <span class='variableText'>for</span> Loop
                    Structure:
                    A for loop is characterized by its well-defined structure, consisting of three
                    essential components: initialization, condition, and iteration. This loop is your
                    go-to choice when you know precisely how many times you want to repeat a specific
                    task.
                </p>
                <p> Use Cases:
                    The for loop shines when you have a clear idea of the number of iterations required.
                    Common use cases include iterating over the elements of an array, looping a specific
                    number of times, or any scenario where a precise number of iterations is needed.
                </p>

                </p><u>Breaking the loop </u></p>
                <p>Normally, a loop exits when its condition becomes falsy.

                    But we can force the exit at any time using the special break directive.

                    For example, the loop below asks the user for a series of numbers, “breaking” when no
                    number is entered:
                </p>

                <p>let sum = 0;

                    while (true) {

                    let value = +prompt("Enter a number", '');

                    if (!value) break; // (*)

                    sum += value;

                    }
                    alert( 'Sum: ' + sum );
                    The break directive is activated at the line (*) if the user enters an empty line or
                    cancels the input. It stops the loop immediately, passing control to the first line
                    after the loop. Namely, alert.

                    The combination “infinite loop + break as needed” is great for situations when a loop’s
                    condition must be checked not in the beginning or end of the loop, but in the middle or
                    even in several places of its body.
                </p>

                <p><u>Common Use Cases for Loops</u></p>
                <p>Common Use Cases for Loops:
                    Loops are incredibly versatile and are used in various scenarios in programming.
                    Here are some common use cases:

                    Iterating Over Arrays: Loops are used to go through each element in an array and
                    perform actions on them.

                    User Input Validation: Loops can be used to repeatedly ask the user for input until
                    valid data is provided.

                    Data Processing: Loops are used to process large sets of data, such as reading from
                    a file or fetching data from a database.

                    Creating Patterns: You can use loops to create patterns or shapes, such as drawing a
                    triangle of asterisks.

                    Repeating Actions: When you need to repeat a specific action multiple times, like
                    sending emails to a list of recipients.
                </p>

                <p><u>Caution</u></p>
                <p>While loops are powerful tools, it's important to use them carefully to avoid
                    infinite loops, which can crash your program. Infinite loops occur when the loop's
                    condition is always true, and the loop never exits. To avoid this, make sure that
                    the loop's condition eventually becomes false.
                </p>

            <!-- Basic Operators and assignment -->
            <div class="page-content" id="item12-content">
                <p><u>Basic Operators+Assignment</u></p>
                <p>An operator is a special character or series of characters that perform a task in JavaScript.They are
                    like tools that help you manipulate and work with different types of values in your code. Think of
                    them as the tools you use in a toolbox to accomplish different tasks.
                </p>

                <p><u>Arithmetic Operations</u></p>
                <p> The following arithmetic operations are supported:

                    Addition +,
                    Subtraction -,
                    Multiplication *,
                    Division /,
                    Remainder %,
                    Exponentiation **.
                    The first four are straightforward, while % and ** need a few words about them.
                </p>

                <p><u>Remainder %</u></p>
                <p>
                    The remainder operator %, despite its appearance, is not related to percents.

                    The result of a % b is the remainder of the integer division of a by b.

                    For instance:

                    alert( 5 % 2 ); // 1, the remainder of 5 divided by 2
                    alert( 8 % 3 ); // 2, the remainder of 8 divided by 3
                    alert( 8 % 4 ); // 0, the remainder of 8 divided by 4
                </p>
                <p>
                    Exponentiation **
                    The exponentiation operator a ** b raises a to the power of b.

                    In school maths, we write that as ab.

                    For instance:

                    alert( 2 ** 2 ); // 2² = 4
                    alert( 2 ** 3 ); // 2³ = 8
                    alert( 2 ** 4 ); // 2⁴ = 16
                    Just like in maths, the exponentiation operator is defined for non-integer numbers as well.

                    For example, a square root is an exponentiation by ½:

                    alert( 4 ** (1/2) ); // 2 (power of 1/2 is the same as a square root)
                    alert( 8 ** (1/3) ); // 2 (power of 1/3 is the same as a cubic root)
                    String concatenation with binary +
                    Let’s meet the features of JavaScript operators that are beyond school arithmetics.

                    Usually, the plus operator + sums numbers.

                    But, if the binary + is applied to strings, it merges (concatenates) them:

                    let s = "my" + "string";
                    alert(s); // mystring
                    Note that if any of the operands is a string, then the other one is converted to a string too.

                    For example:

                    alert( '1' + 2 ); // "12"
                    alert( 2 + '1' ); // "21"
                    See, it doesn’t matter whether the first operand is a string or the second one.

                    Here’s a more complex example:

                    alert(2 + 2 + '1' ); // "41" and not "221"
                    Here, operators work one after another. The first + sums two numbers, so it returns 4, then the
                    next + adds the string 1 to it, so it’s like 4 + '1' = '41'.

                    alert('1' + 2 + 2); // "122" and not "14"
                    Here, the first operand is a string, the compiler treats the other two operands as strings too.
                    The 2 gets concatenated to '1', so it’s like '1' + 2 = "12" and "12" + 2 = "122".

                    The binary + is the only operator that supports strings in such a way. Other arithmetic
                    operators work only with numbers and always convert their operands to numbers.

                    Here’s the demo for subtraction and division:

                    alert( 6 - '2' ); // 4, converts '2' to a number
                    alert( '6' / '2' ); // 3, converts both operands to numbers
                </p>

                <p><u>Assignment</u></p>
                <p>
                    Let’s note that an assignment = is also an operator.

                    let x = 2 * 2 + 1;

                    alert( x ); // 5
                    Assignment = returns a value
                    The fact of = being an operator, not a “magical” language construct has an interesting implication.

                    All operators in JavaScript return a value. That’s obvious for + and -, but also true for =.

                    The call x = value writes the value into x and then returns it.

                    Here’s a demo that uses an assignment as part of a more complex expression:

                    let a = 1;
                    let b = 2;

                    let c = 3 - (a = b + 1);

                    alert( a ); // 3
                    alert( c ); // 0
                    In the example above, the result of expression (a = b + 1) is the value which was assigned to a
                    (that is 3). It is then used for further evaluations.

                <p><u>Modify-in-place</u></p>
                <p>We often need to apply an operator to a variable and store the new result in that same variable.

                    For example:

                    let n = 2;
                    n = n + 5;
                    n = n * 2;
                    This notation can be shortened using the operators += and *=:

                    let n = 2;
                    n += 5; // now n = 7 (same as n = n + 5)
                    n *= 2; // now n = 14 (same as n = n * 2)

                    alert( n ); // 14
                    Short “modify-and-assign” operators exist for all arithmetical and bitwise operators: /=, -=, etc.

                    Such operators have the same precedence as a normal assignment, so they run after most other
                    calculations:

                    let n = 2;

                    n *= 3 + 5; // right part evaluated first, same as n *= 8

                    alert( n ); // 16
                    Increment/decrement
                    Increasing or decreasing a number by one is among the most common numerical operations.

                    So, there are special operators for it:

                    Increment ++ increases a variable by 1:

                    let counter = 2;
                    counter++; // works the same as counter = counter + 1, but is shorter
                    alert( counter ); // 3
                    Decrement -- decreases a variable by 1:

                    let counter = 2;
                    counter--; // works the same as counter = counter - 1, but is shorter
                    alert( counter ); // 1
                    Important:
                    Increment/decrement can only be applied to variables. Trying to use it on a value like 5++ will give
                    an
                    error.

                    The operators ++ and -- can be placed either before or after a variable.

                    When the operator goes after the variable, it is in “postfix form”: counter++.
                    The “prefix form” is when the operator goes before the variable: ++counter.
                    Both of these statements do the same thing: increase counter by 1.

            <div class="page-content" id="item13-content">
                <p><u>Comparisons</u></p>
                <p>We know many comparison operators from maths.

                    In JavaScript they are written like this:

                    Greater/less than: a > b, a < b. Greater/less than or equals: a>= b, a <= b. Equals: a==b, please
                            note the double equality sign==means the equality test, while a single one a=b means an
                            assignment. Not equals: In maths the notation is ≠, but in JavaScript it’s written as a !=b.
                            In this article we’ll learn more about different types of comparisons, how JavaScript makes
                            them, including important peculiarities. At the end you’ll find a good recipe to avoid
                            “JavaScript quirks”-related issues. Boolean is the result All comparison operators return a
                            boolean value: true – means “yes”, “correct” or “the truth”. false – means “no”, “wrong” or
                            “not the truth”. For example: alert( 2> 1 ); // true (correct)
                            alert( 2 == 1 ); // false (wrong)
                            alert( 2 != 1 ); // true (correct)
                            A comparison result can be assigned to a variable, just like any value:

                            let result = 5 > 4; // assign the result of the comparison
                            alert( result ); // true </p>
                <p><u>Comparison of Different Types</u></p>
                <p>Comparison of different types
                    When comparing values of different types, JavaScript converts the values to numbers.

                    For example:

                    alert( '2' > 1 ); // true, string '2' becomes a number 2
                    alert( '01' == 1 ); // true, string '01' becomes a number 1
                    For boolean values, true becomes 1 and false becomes 0.

                    For example:

                    alert( true == 1 ); // true
                    alert( false == 0 ); // true
                    A funny consequence
                    It is possible that at the same time:

                    Two values are equal.
                    One of them is true as a boolean and the other one is false as a boolean.
                    For example:

                    let a = 0;
                    alert( Boolean(a) ); // false

                    let b = "0";
                    alert( Boolean(b) ); // true

                    alert(a == b); // true!
                    From JavaScript’s standpoint, this result is quite normal. An equality check converts values using
                    the numeric conversion (hence "0" becomes 0), while the explicit Boolean conversion uses another set
                    of rules.</p>
                <p><u>Comparison with null and undefined</u></p>
                <p>There’s a non-intuitive behavior when null or undefined are compared to other values.

                    For a strict equality check ===
                    These values are different, because each of them is a different type.

                    alert( null === undefined ); // false
                    For a non-strict check ==
                    There’s a special rule. These two are a “sweet couple”: they equal each other (in the sense of
                    ==), but not any other value.

                    alert( null == undefined ); // true
                    For maths and other comparisons <>
                        <=>=
                            null/undefined are converted to numbers: null becomes 0, while undefined becomes NaN.

            <!-- Logical Operators -->
            <div class="page-content" id="item14-content">
                <p><u>Logical operators</u></p>
                <p>There are four logical operators in JavaScript: || (OR), && (AND), ! (NOT), ?? (Nullish
                    Coalescing). Here we cover the first three.
                </p>
                <p> Although they are called “logical”, they can be applied to values of any type, not only boolean.
                    Their result can also be of any type.
                </p>
                <p>Let's see the details. </p>
                <p>|| (OR)
                    The “OR” operator is represented with two vertical line symbols:

                    result = a || b;
                    In classical programming, the logical OR is meant to manipulate boolean values only. If any of
                    its arguments
                    are true, it returns true, otherwise it returns false.

                    In JavaScript, the operator is a little bit trickier and more powerful. But first, let’s see
                    what happens
                    with boolean values.

                    There are four possible logical combinations:

                    alert( true || true ); // true
                    alert( false || true ); // true
                    alert( true || false ); // true
                    alert( false || false ); // false
                    As we can see, the result is always true except for the case when both operands are false.

                    If an operand is not a boolean, it’s converted to a boolean for the evaluation.

                    For instance, the number 1 is treated as true, the number 0 as false:

                    if (1 || 0) { // works just like if( true || false )
                    alert( 'truthy!' );
                    }
                    Most of the time, OR || is used in an if statement to test if any of the given conditions is
                    true.

                    For example:

                    let hour = 9;

                    if (hour < 10 || hour> 18) {
                        alert( 'The office is closed.' );
                        }
                        We can pass more conditions:

                        let hour = 12;
                        let isWeekend = true;

                        if (hour < 10 || hour> 18 || isWeekend) {
                            alert( 'The office is closed.' ); // it is the weekend
                            }
                            OR "||" finds the first truthy value
                            The logic described above is somewhat classical. Now, let’s bring in the “extra”
                            features of
                            JavaScript.

                            The extended algorithm works as follows.

                            Given multiple OR’ed values:

                            result = value1 || value2 || value3;
                            The OR || operator does the following:

                            Evaluates operands from left to right.
                            For each operand, converts it to boolean. If the result is true, stops and returns the
                            original
                            value of that operand.
                            If all operands have been evaluated (i.e. all were false), returns the last operand.
                            A value is returned in its original form, without the conversion.

                            In other words, a chain of OR || returns the first truthy value or the last one if no
                            truthy value
                            is found.

                            For instance:

                            alert( 1 || 0 ); // 1 (1 is truthy)

                            alert( null || 1 ); // 1 (1 is the first truthy value)
                            alert( null || 0 || 1 ); // 1 (the first truthy value)

                            alert( undefined || null || 0 ); // 0 (all falsy, returns the last value)
                            This leads to some interesting usage compared to a “pure, classical, boolean-only OR”.

                            Getting the first truthy value from a list of variables or expressions.

                            For instance, we have firstName, lastName and nickName variables, all optional (i.e. can
                            be
                            undefined or have falsy values).

                            Let’s use OR || to choose the one that has the data and show it (or "Anonymous" if
                            nothing set):

                            let firstName = "";
                            let lastName = "";
                            let nickName = "SuperCoder";

                            alert( firstName || lastName || nickName || "Anonymous"); // SuperCoder
                            If all variables were falsy, "Anonymous" would show up.

                            Short-circuit evaluation.

                            Another feature of OR || operator is the so-called “short-circuit” evaluation.

                            It means that || processes its arguments until the first truthy value is reached, and
                            then the value
                            is returned immediately, without even touching the other argument.

                            The importance of this feature becomes obvious if an operand isn’t just a value, but an
                            expression
                            with a side effect, such as a variable assignment or a function call.

                            In the example below, only the second message is printed:

                            true || alert("not printed");
                            false || alert("printed");
                            In the first line, the OR || operator stops the evaluation immediately upon seeing true,
                            so the
                            alert isn’t run.

                            Sometimes, people use this feature to execute commands only if the condition on the left
                            part is
                            falsy.

                            && (AND)
                            The AND operator is represented with two ampersands &&:

                            result = a && b;
                            In classical programming, AND returns true if both operands are truthy and false
                            otherwise:

                            alert( true && true ); // true
                            alert( false && true ); // false
                            alert( true && false ); // false
                            alert( false && false ); // false
                            An example with if:

                            let hour = 12;
                            let minute = 30;

                            if (hour == 12 && minute == 30) {
                            alert( 'The time is 12:30' );
                            }
                            Just as with OR, any value is allowed as an operand of AND:

                            if (1 && 0) { // evaluated as true && false
                            alert( "won't work, because the result is falsy" );
                            }
                            AND “&&” finds the first falsy value
                            Given multiple AND’ed values:

                            result = value1 && value2 && value3;
                            The AND && operator does the following:

                            Evaluates operands from left to right.
                            For each operand, converts it to a boolean. If the result is false, stops and returns
                            the original
                            value of that operand.
                            If all operands have been evaluated (i.e. all were truthy), returns the last operand.
                            In other words, AND returns the first falsy value or the last value if none were found.

                            The rules above are similar to OR. The difference is that AND returns the first falsy
                            value while OR
                            returns the first truthy one.

                            Examples:

                            // if the first operand is truthy,
                            // AND returns the second operand:
                            alert( 1 && 0 ); // 0
                            alert( 1 && 5 ); // 5

                            // if the first operand is falsy,
                            // AND returns it. The second operand is ignored
                            alert( null && 5 ); // null
                            alert( 0 && "no matter what" ); // 0
                            We can also pass several values in a row. See how the first falsy one is returned:

                            alert( 1 && 2 && null && 3 ); // null
                            When all values are truthy, the last value is returned:

                            alert( 1 && 2 && 3 ); // 3, the last one
                            Precedence of AND && is higher than OR ||
                            The precedence of AND && operator is higher than OR ||.

                            So the code a && b || c && d is essentially the same as if the && expressions were in
                            parentheses:
                            (a && b) || (c && d).

                            Don’t replace if with || or &&
                            Sometimes, people use the AND && operator as a "shorter way to write if".

                            For instance:

                            let x = 1;

                            (x > 0) && alert( 'Greater than zero!' );
                            The action in the right part of && would execute only if the evaluation reaches it. That
                            is, only if
                            (x > 0) is true.

                            So we basically have an analogue for:

                            let x = 1;

                            if (x > 0) alert( 'Greater than zero!' );
                            Although, the variant with && appears shorter, if is more obvious and tends to be a
                            little bit more
                            readable. So we recommend using every construct for its purpose: use if if we want if
                            and use && if
                            we want AND.

                            ! (NOT)
                            The boolean NOT operator is represented with an exclamation sign !.

                            The syntax is pretty simple:

                            result = !value;
                            The operator accepts a single argument and does the following:

                            Converts the operand to boolean type: true/false.
                            Returns the inverse value.
                            For instance:

                            alert( !true ); // false
                            alert( !0 ); // true
                            A double NOT !! is sometimes used for converting a value to boolean type:

                            alert( !!"non-empty string" ); // true
                            alert( !!null ); // false
                            That is, the first NOT converts the value to boolean and returns the inverse, and the
                            second NOT
                            inverses it again. In the end, we have a plain value-to-boolean conversion.

                            There’s a little more verbose way to do the same thing – a built-in Boolean function:

                            alert( Boolean("non-empty string") ); // true
                            alert( Boolean(null) ); // false
                            The precedence of NOT ! is the highest of all logical operators, so it always executes
                            first, before
                            && or ||.

            <div class="page-content" id="item15-content">
                <p><u>Whitespace</u></p>
                <p>Whitespace refers to characters that provide the space between other characters. JavaScript has the
                    following whitespace:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Carriage return
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Space
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        New Line
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Tab
                    </li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <p>JavaScript engine ignores whitespace. However, you can use whitespace to format the code to make it
                    easy to read and maintain.
                </p>
                <p>The following JavaScript code doesn't use whitespace:</p>
                <pre
                    class="codes"><code class="language-javascript">  let formatted = true; if (formatted) {console.log('The code is not easy to read');}</code></pre>
                <p>It is equivalent to the following code that uses whitespace. Hence, this code is much easier to read:
                </p>
                <pre class="codes"><code class="language-javascript">  let formatted = true;
  if (formatted) {
        console.log('The code is easy to read');
  }</code></pre>
                <p>Note that JavaScript bundlers remove all whitespace from JavaScript files and put them into a single
                    file for deployment. By doing this, JavaScript bundlers make the JavaScript code lighter and faster
                    to load in the web browsers.
                </p>

                <p><u>Statements</u></p>
                <p>A statement is a code that declares a variable or instructs the JavaScript engine to do a task. A
                    simple statement is terminated by a semicolon (;). Although the semicolon (;) is optional; you
                    should always use it to terminate a statement.
                </p>

                <p><u>Comments</u></p>
                <p>Comments allow you to add notes or hints to JavaScript code. When executing the code, the JavaScript
                    engine ignores the comments.
                </p>
                <p>A single-line comment starts with two forward-slashes characters
                    (//). A single-line comment makes all the text following the // on the same line into a
                    comment.<br>For
                    example: // this is a single-line comment.
                </p>
                <p>A block comment begins with a forward slash and
                    asterisk /* and ends with the opposite */ as in the following example: <br>
                    /* This is a block comment
                    that can span multiple lines */
                </p>
                <p><u>Cases</u></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Camel case:
                        In camel case, you start a name with a lowercaseletter. If the name has multiple words, the
                        later words will start with an uppercase letter. <br><br>
                        Ex: <span class='variableCode'>firstName</span>, <span class='variableCode'>lastName</span>
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        Pascal case:
                        This case is similar to camel case.
                        The only difference between the two is that pascal case requires the first letter of the first
                        word to also be capitalized.
                        So, when using pascal case, every word starts with an uppercase letter (in contrast to camel
                        case, where the first word is in lowercase). <br><br>

                        Ex: <span class='variableCode'>NumberOfDonuts = 34</span>, <span class='variableCode'>FavePhrase
                            = "Hellow World"</span>
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        Snake Case:
                        For snake case, all letters remain lowercase. If the name has multiple words, the later words
                        will start with small letters and you use a underscore (_) to separate the words. <br><br>

                        Ex: <span class='variableCode'>first_name</span>, <span class='variableCode'>last_name</span>
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        Screaming Snake Case:
                        This one is just like the regular snake case except the names are all capitalized. <br><br>

                        Ex: <span class='variableCode'>FIRST_NAME</span>, <span class='variableCode'>LAST_NAME</span>
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        Kebab Case:
                        The kebab case is very similar to snake case.
                        The difference between snake case and kebab case is that kebab case separates each word with a
                        dash character, -, instead of an underscore. The words are all lowercase. <br><br>

                        Ex: <span class='variableCode'>hello-my-name-is</span>, <span
                            class='variableCode'>number-of-donuts = 12</span>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                    on the parts that convention is utilized, here are the general conventions to consider for

            <div class="page-content" id="item16-content">
                <p><u>The DOM (Document Object Model)</u></p>
                <p>DOM is like a map or a blueprint that web browsers use to understand and manipulate web pages.
                    Think of it as a way for your web browser to organize and access all the different parts of a web
                    page, like text, images, buttons, and links.
                </p>

                <p> Imagine a web page as a book, and the DOM is
                    like the index or table of contents of that book. It
                    tells you where each chapter or section is, what page it's on, and how you can interact with it.
                    Although this is the general idea of DOM, here is a step by step breakdown of how DOM is
                    created:
                </p>

                <ul style="list-style-type:decimal">
                    <li>Requesting a Web Page: When you enter a URL in your web browser's address bar or click on a

                        your browser sends a request to a web server to fetch the corresponding HTML document.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        Receiving the HTML: The web server responds to the request by sending back the HTML document
                        associated with the requested URL. This HTML document contains the structured content of the
                        web
                        page.

                                its
                                structure and extract meaningful information from it

                        Building the DOM: As the browser parses the HTML, it constructs the DOM tree. The DOM tree
                        is a hierarchical representation of the HTML document, where each HTML element (e.g., headings,
                        paragraphs, images) becomes a node in the tree, and the tree's structure reflects the
                        structure of the web page.

                    <li>
                        CSS and JavaScript: In process, the browser also processes any associated CSS
                        stylesheets and JS code. CSS styles are used to determine how the content is displayed
                        (e.g., colors, fonts, layout), and JavaScript can dynamically manipulate the DOM.

                    <li>
                        Rendering the Web Page: Once the DOM is created and CSS styles are applied, the browser uses
                        this
                        information to render the web page on your screen. It calculates the layout, positions
                        elements,
                        and
                        displays everything according to the specified styles.

                    <li>
                        Interactivity: At this point, the web page is fully loaded and interactive. You can click on
                        links,
                        submit forms, and interact with the page's elements. JavaScript can also respond to user
                        actions
                        and
                        further modify the DOM, making dynamic changes to the page without requiring a full page
                        reload.

                <p><u>DOM Methods</u></P>
                <p>DOM Methods, as the name might suggest, are ways in which JavaScript can interact with the
                    Doument Object Model. In other words, think of DOM methods as like a set of tools that
                    JavaScript uses to interact with and manipulate the elements on a web page. In detail, they
                    are functions that are built into JavaScript, specifically designed for working with the
                    Document Object Model. For example, with appropriate DOM methods, one can access/create HTML
                    elements, manipulate content, and many more.
                </p>
                <p>Here are some examples of common DOM methods that have been useful for my understanding:</p>
                <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
                    <li>Selecting DOM Elements:
                        <br>

                        <div class="codeBox">
                            <pre
                                class="codes"><code class="language-javascript">  const myElement = document.getElementById('myElementId'); </code></pre>
                        </div>
                        <button type="button" class="collapsible">&nbsp; Details</button>
                        <div class="content">
                            <p>This code selects an HTML element with the ID <span class="blackCode">myElementId</span>
                                and stores <br>
                                it in
                                the variable "myElement"</p>
                        </div>

                        <pre class="codes"><code>  const newParagraph = document.createElement('p');

                        <p class="codeDescription"> // Append the new paragraph to an existing element </p>

                    <li> Event Handling:

                        <p class="codeDescription"> // Add a click event listener to an element</p>
                        <pre class="codes"><code>  myElement.addEventListener('click', function() {

                            it triggers the provided function, which displays an alert with the message "Element
                            clicked!"</p>
                    </li> <br>

                <p>While there are handful of other DOM methods available and even more layers to the ones
                    discussed above, these DOM methods can serve as the ground work for first grasping the idea of what
                    DOM
                    methods are and how they work.
